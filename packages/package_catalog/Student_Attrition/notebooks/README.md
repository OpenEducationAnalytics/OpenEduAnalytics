## Attrition Pre-Processing

The [Attrition Preprocessing notebook](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/packages/package_catalog/Student_Attrition/notebooks/attrition_preprocesing.ipynb/) implements functions which land data artifacts from the RAI dashboard in tabular format. Data is placed in Stage 1 storage by leveraging the OEA framework. The notebook should only be run in the context of the [Attrition package pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/tree/ca35c80060a4653a873ff83ce4ff4cc3081aeb62/packages/package_catalog/Student_Attrition/pipeline).
