## Module information 

- Version: 0.2
- Dependencies: OEA framework v0.8

## Description 

### Overview

The primary goal of the Ed-Fi module is to provide advanced analytics capabilities over multi-year and multi-district education data. 

The Ed-Fi module is responsible for incremental data landing from multiple Ed-Fi Instances into a raw Layer (Stage 1) in ADLS. The module leverages Azure Synapse pipelines to extract data from the Ed-Fi API and employs pipelines and dataflows for data ingestion into an enriched layer (Stage 2). Stage 2 consists of two containers: "Ingested" and "Refined." The raw Layer contains data in JSON format, while the enriched layer uses the DELTA format.

The module processes 129 resources and 201 descriptors exposed by the Ed-Fi API, transforming the raw JSON data into the lakehouse using dataflows. Once the data is available in Stage 2 in DELTA format, users can create a SQL Serverless DB and define SQL views for various use cases.

The documentation includes Modified [AMT](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/EDFITOOLS/AMT+Overview) (Analytics Middle Tier) Views, adapted to work with the SQL Serverless DB created in Stage 2. The Modified [AMT](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/EDFITOOLS/AMT+Overview) Views serve as a starter pack for users to begin analyzing their education data immediately.

### Target audience 

The Ed-Fi Data Integration Module is primarily designed to meet the needs of the US state Departments of Education (DoEs) and school districts. It aims to address the challenges faced by these entities in data collection, reporting, analytics, and exchange. The module provides a reference architecture through the OEA (Open Education Analytics) framework, reducing the time spent on architecture design and accelerating implementation. It offers a streamlined setup process, enabling customers to establish a data lakehouse on top of their Ed-Fi Operational Data Store (ODS) within 30 minutes.  

### Problem statement 

The education sector faces several challenges in data collection, reporting, and analytics, particularly concerning the interactions between US state Departments of Education and school districts. The current process of data collection and reporting is labor-intensive and time-consuming for both parties. Additionally, there is a lack of infrastructure for easy data collection, analytics, and exchange between state DoEs and school districts. Data quality remains a significant barrier, and districts rarely receive valuable data insights back from the states based on the data they report.

To address these challenges, the Ed-Fi Data Integration Module allows for analytics over multi-year, multi-district education data by leveraging a data lakehouse architecture, Azure Synapse pipelines, and dataflows. It enables customers to create a SQL Serverless database over the enriched DELTA files, defining SQL views tailored to their specific use cases.

To use this module, follow these additional steps:

    1. Clone and set up the latest version (v0.8rc2) of OEA. Publish all the assets in your Synapse workspace.
    2. Add your clientId and clientSecret to your linked KeyVault:
       - In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group that contains your Synapse workspace.
       - Find the Key Vault within the resource group and go to its page.
       - Create a new secret named "edfi-clientid" and set it to your clientId.
       - Create a new secret named "edfi-clientsecret" and set it to your clientSecret.
    3. Configure the parameters in the 0_main_edfi pipeline:
       - Set kvName to the name of the Key Vault where you added your clientId and clientSecret.
       - Set ApiUrl to the base URL of your Ed-Fi API. The default provided is for the test dataset provided by Ed-Fi.
       - If you want to target specific change versions, set minChangeVer and maxChangeVer; otherwise, leave them empty.
       - Set DistrictId, SchoolYear, and InstanceId only if they are applicable to your Ed-Fi instance.
    4. Run the 0_main_edfi pipeline to start using the module.

#### Notes:
 - For all your Ed-Fi instances, create applications in the Admin App with the necessary permissions. Generally, read access is required for all entities. Failure to grant the required permissions can result in authorization issues during pipeline execution.

## Additional information - TO-DO IF APPLICABLE - DAVID

### Approximate hosting costs

**Sample copy:** 

The Azure Durable Function does come with a hosting cost in Azure however it is generally fairly minimal when using the consumption model (which is the default).

In our environment, most days did not exceed $0.20 USD per day. A full reload of the Canvas data cost ~$0.30 USD. For most use cases we anticipate the Azure Function and associated function storage would not exceed ~$5-10 USD per month. Costs for your environment will vary based on number of active staff/students in the platform.

Note the pricing does not consider the cost of hosting data in your Data Lake, Synapse overheads, spark pools, etc. - just the additional function and associated storage.

As always, it is suggested you monitor and review costs within your own environment.

### Performance - TO-DO DAVID

**Sample copy:** 

The Azure Durable Function has been designed with asynchronous I/O and scalability in mind. It does not download files directly, and instead invokes [start_copy_from_url](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient?view=storage-py-v12#start-copy-from-url-source-url--metadata-none--incremental-copy-false----kwargs-) using the Python SDK.

In our testing, the function was able to download ~7 years worth of data (200 GB) in under 10 minutes. Processing the data into stage2 took 1-2 hours total due to the type conversion from CSV (strings) to Parquet.

Loads are incremental (only new/changes files are processed), so subsequent runs are significantly quicker - typically in the order of minutes.
